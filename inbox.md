- Economics comes from the fact that humans have needs and wants
- goods objects, services other
- resources produce goods and services
  - also known as factors of production
  - can be:
    - labor
    - machines
    - factories
    - natural
- scarcity arises when the supply does not meet the demand
- scarcity is the situation in which resources are finite, whereas wants are infinite
- due to scarcity it is important to avoid wasting resources
- economics is the study of choices leading to the best possible use of scarce resources in order to best satisfy unlimited human needs and wants
- Basics economic questions
  - what to produce
  - how to produce
  - for whom to produce
- resource allocation: assigning available resrouces to specific uses among possible alternatives
  - change: reallocation
  - overallocation and underallocation (supply >, supply <)
- 4 factors of production
  - land
  - labour
  - capital
    - tools not money
    - types:
      - physical
        - machines
      - human
        - skills
      - natural
        - ex: OIL
      - financial
        - stocks
  - entrepreneurship
- opportunity cost: the value of the next best alternative that must be given up to obtain something else
- Production possiblities model
  - product vs product (results based on different usage of resources)
  - constant = linear
  - increasing = round
- social sciences = academic disciplines that study human society and social relationships
  - economics is a social science bc based on the social scientific method
  - social scientific method =
    1. make observation
    2. identify variables
    3. make a hypothesis on relationship
    4. make assumptions
    5. test hypothesis and finite
    6. compare predictions
- in economics models are equations or diagrams
- theory = general explanation for relationship usually based on successfully tested hypotheses
- laws is a consise universal statement, tested successfuly many times
- assumptions in econ model building
  - ceteris paribus = relationship between 2 vars only works if others do not change
  - rational economic decision making = people do what is best for them
- positive economics = describe economy = how things are (unemployment is 5%)
- normative economics = create policy = how things should be (unemployment should be lower)
- microeconomics = behaviour of individuals/buisnesses
- macroeconomics = eocnomy as a whole
- market = buyers sellers goods services
  - one or many places
  - product markets = goods/services
  - resources markets = factors of prod
  - competitive market = rivals compete to achieve objective
  - market power = the control that a seller has over the price of it's product (monopoly market)
- demand = behaviour of consumers
  - inidividual demand = behaviour of a consumer
  - quantity bought based on price
  - negative causal relationship price -> quantity
  - marginal benefit (you only need so much of a good) -> demand curve slopes downward
  - market demand = demand of all consumers
  - non-price determinants:
    - income,
      - normal goods: more income, curve shifts right
      - inferiour goods: more income, curve shifts left
    - preferences
    - price of substitute goods (competitors), price increases, demand curve shifts right
    - price of complimentary goods, price decreases, demand curve shifts right
    - population, population increases, demand curve shifts right
  - shifts, Price: P1 to P2, Quantity: Q1 to Q2, Demand: D1 to D2
- individual supply: amount of good a firm is _willing and able to produce_
- law of supply = as price increases quantity supplied increases
- market supply = sum of all individual firms supplies of a good
- vertical supply curve: fixed quantity of good supplied
  - bc: no time to produce more (movie tickets )
  - no possiblility of producing more of it: antiques
- non price determinants
  - cost of FoP: PoFoP rises supply shifts to left, more expensive to make
  - price of related goods, if the price of one related good increaes, the other curves shift to the left
  - producer expectations: witholding product in the hopes of selling it later a t a higher price
    - decreasing quantity causes left shift, selling causes right
  - taxes: treated as Cost of Production, imposition or elimination of new taxes would shift the curves
  - subsidy opposite of a tax, opposite effect
  - number of firms: increase in firms, increases supply: shift right
  - shocks: usually decrease (potato famine)
  - supply and demand will always ensure price will go back to equilibrium
  - market equilibirum: when the supply and demand are equal resulting in a constant price
    - intersection of supply and demand curves
    - eqlbrm price: price at equlbrm
    - eqlbrm quantity
  - change in NPD (non price determinants)of supply and demand can affect equilibrium
- economic/allocative efficiency = how well u can use FoP
- consumer surplus = highet price willing to pay minus price actually paid
- producer surplus = price sold - lowest price
