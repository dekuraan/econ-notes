- Economics comes from the fact that humans have needs and wants
- goods objects, services other
- resources produce goods and services
  - also known as factors of production
  - can be:
    - labor
    - machines
    - factories
    - natural
- scarcity arises when the supply does not meet the demand
- scarcity is the situation in which resources are finite, whereas wants are infinite
- due to scarcity it is important to avoid wasting resources
- economics is the study of choices leading to the best possible use of scarce resources in order to best satisfy unlimited human needs and wants
- Basics economic questions
  - what to produce
  - how to produce
  - for whom to produce
- resource allocation: assigning available resrouces to specific uses among possible alternatives
  - change: reallocation
  - overallocation and underallocation (supply >, supply <)
- 4 factors of production
  - land
  - labour
  - capital
    - tools not money
    - types:
      - physical
        - machines
      - human
        - skills
      - natural
        - ex: OIL
      - financial
        - stocks
  - entrepreneurship
- opportunity cost: the value of the next best alternative that must be given up to obtain something else
- Production possiblities model
  - product vs product (results based on different usage of resources)
  - constant = linear
  - increasing = round
- social sciences = academic disciplines that study human society and social relationships
  - economics is a social science bc based on the social scientific method
  - social scientific method =
    1. make observation
    2. identify variables
    3. make a hypothesis on relationship
    4. make assumptions
    5. test hypothesis and finite
    6. compare predictions
- in economics models are equations or diagrams
- theory = general explanation for relationship usually based on successfully tested hypotheses
- laws is a consise universal statement, tested successfuly many times
- assumptions in econ model building
  - ceteris paribus = relationship between 2 vars only works if others do not change
  - rational economic decision making = people do what is best for them
- positive economics = describe economy = how things are (unemployment is 5%)
- normative economics = create policy = how things should be (unemployment should be lower)
- microeconomics = behaviour of individuals/buisnesses
- macroeconomics = eocnomy as a whole
